# Forecapp

A NeuralProphet GUI to make custom forecasts more accessible

## Development

### Structure

Forecapp is built with a React frontend and a Python/Flask backend. The frontend is compiled to static HTML, Javascript, and CSS files, and the Flask backend is compiled to an executable. Electron delivers the frontend and spins up a child process to run the backend. Requests are routed within the userâ€™s computer via localhost:5050 to the local backend.

### Start development app

1. Install packages. `npm install` in both main directory and /client directory. Needed Python packages are listed in backend/requirements.txt
2. Start the frontend from the root directory `npm start`
3. Start the backend. From /backend directory, `python app.py`

### Build instructions

1. Install packages. `npm install` in both main directory and /client directory. Needed Python packages are listed in backend/requirements.txt
2. Compile Python backend. `pyinstaller app.spec`
3. Build frontend. From /client directory, `npm run build`
4. Compile binary. `npm run dist`
   The final application will be written to the /dist directory
